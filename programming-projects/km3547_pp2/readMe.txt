My code was designed to be used in accordance with CreditCardTester.java. All my instance variables were chosen from the problem prompt and the parameters needed from CreditCardTester. In order to check if the string entered in CreditCardTester was valid, I created 6 separate methods that corresponded to the 6 criterion. Each method was private because it was only called in the CreditCard() class and had no parameters. If the check was failed, an error code was assigned to the number check that the credit card number failed in order to track what is wrong with the number. My main check method called every other check method within the CreditCard() class and checked if an error code number was assigned. The boolean returned from my check() method is then passed into isValid in order to return whether the number is valid or not back into CreditCardTester. Personally, I believe that the isValid method is dispensable because the boolean returned by the check() method is the same boolean that the isValid() method would return, but the isValid method is necessary for the CreditCardTester class.
